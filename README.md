# hello-world
This is where I will develop my first BLOG.
I've thought about writing a Blog for a very long time, but I wasn't sure I would have anything useful to say on an ongoing basis.  However, after reading Austin Kleon's book, Show Your Work, I learned that a Blog is a good place to document my work journey by "showing my work" as I navigate the process from inspiration to creation and back.  So today I'm starting my Blog.
